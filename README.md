# RP1Hardmode

This repository is for storing the save file (and craft files) of my RP-1 Hard Difficulty playthrough that I am also streaming/recording. Feel free to grab the craft files etc.

I've also included my .ckan file so you can quickly get the same setup as me. Your first stop should be the [RO & RP-1 Install Guide](https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0/wiki/RO-&-RP-1-Installation-for-1.10.1) -- I am using the High graphics preset in that install. Once you've done that, follow its link to the Advanced guide and follow the instructions for setting your CKAN compatibility versions and for adding the MechJeb dev repo. Once that's done, you can install from my .ckan file.

You will have to manually install a few mods, once the above is complete.
