# RP1Hardmode

This repository is for storing the save file (and craft files) of my RP-1 Hard Difficulty playthrough that I am also streaming/recording. Feel free to grab the craft files etc.

I've also included my .ckan file so you can quickly get the same setup as me. Make sure to follow the Install Guide as to how to set version compatibility overrides and add the MechJeb 2 dev repo. https://github.com/KSP-RO/RP-0/wiki/RO-&-RP-1-Installation-for-1.10.1

You will need to manually create folders named NoNonRO and NoNonRP0 in GameData.

You will have to manually install a few mods:
* Conformal Decals https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/194802-18-111-conformal-decals-028-decals-done-the-right-way/
* TUFX https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/192212-19x-tufx-post-processing/


I have not included Kerbal Konstructs because it requires some manual setup and dll replacement.
